        "Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language that emphasizes code readability, simplicity, and ease of use. It was created by Guido van Rossum and was first released in 1991. Python is known for its clear syntax that allows developers to express concepts in fewer lines of code than in many other programming languages.\n",
        "\n",
        "Python is an object-oriented, dynamic language, meaning it supports classes and objects and can handle data types without needing to declare them explicitly. Python supports multiple programming paradigms, such as procedural, functional, and object-oriented programming.\n",

        "**Answer:**\n",
        "\n",
        "The difference between **lists** being mutable and **tuples** being immutable in Python is a design choice based on their intended use cases and performance considerations.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Why Lists Are Mutable:\n",
        "1. **Dynamic Size**: Lists are designed to be flexible and allow for changes during runtime. They can grow or shrink by adding or removing elements, which makes them suitable for situations where the collection of items needs to be modified frequently.\n",
        "   - Example: You can append or remove items in a list:\n",
        "     ```python\n",
        "     my_list = [1, 2, 3]\n",
        "     my_list.append(4)  # List can be modified\n",

        "     ```\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Use Case**: Lists are often used when the collection of items will change over time, like storing values that need to be updated or adjusted frequently.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Why Tuples Are Immutable:\n",
        "1. **Fixed Size**: Tuples are designed to be **immutable**, meaning once they are created, their contents cannot be changed. This is ideal for situations where the collection of items should remain constant throughout the program.\n",
        "   - Example: You cannot change an element of a tuple:\n",
        "     ```python\n",
        "     my_tuple = (1, 2, 3)\n",
        "     # my_tuple[0] = 10  # This will throw an error\n",
        "     ```\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Performance**: Because tuples are immutable, they are more memory-efficient and faster for lookups compared to lists. Since their size and content are fixed, Python can optimize their storage and access.\n",
        "   \n",
        "3. **Use Case**: Tuples are useful for representing **fixed collections** of items, like coordinates or constants, where you don't want accidental changes to the data.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Summary:\n",
        "- **Lists** are mutable because they are meant to store collections that can change over time.\n",
        "- **Tuples** are immutable to provide fixed, efficient storage for data that shouldn't be modified after creation.\n",

        "- The `is` operator checks whether two objects **refer to the same memory location**, i.e., if they are **the same object** in memory.\n",

        "\n",
        "### 1. **Implicit Type Casting** (Automatic Type Conversion)\n",
        "- **Definition**: Python automatically converts one data type to another when the conversion is safe and does not cause data loss (such as converting an integer to a float).\n",
        "- **When it happens**: Python handles it automatically when performing operations between different data types (e.g., adding an integer and a float).\n",
        "- **Example**: Converting an integer to a float when performing arithmetic operations.\n",
        "  \n",

        "```python\n",
        "x = 5  # integer\n",
        "y = 2.0  # float\n",
        "result = x + y  # Python automatically converts 'x' to float\n",
        "print(result)  # Output: 7.0 (float)\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "In this case, Python automatically converts the integer `x` to a float before performing the addition, so the result is a float.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 2. **Explicit Type Casting** (Manual Type Conversion)\n",
        "- **Definition**: You manually convert one data type to another using built-in functions like `int()`, `float()`, `str()`, etc.\n",
        "- **When it happens**: You explicitly perform the conversion to ensure the data type is exactly what you want, especially when working with user input or specific operations.\n",
        "- **Example**: Converting a string to an integer or float explicitly using type casting functions.\n",

        "x = \"10.5\"  # string\n",

        "### Common Conditional Statements:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **`if` statement**: Checks if a condition is true, and if so, executes the block of code inside it.\n",

        "   x = -3\n",
        "   if x > 0:\n",

        "\n",
        "The `elif` (short for **\"else if\"**) statement in Python allows you to check multiple conditions in sequence. It is used after an `if` statement to check another condition if the previous `if` condition was **false**.\n",
        "\n",
        "### How `elif` works:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. The program first checks the condition in the `if` statement.\n",
        "2. If the `if` condition is **true**, it executes the block of code inside the `if` block and **skips** the `elif` and `else` blocks.\n",
        "3. If the `if` condition is **false**, it checks the condition in the `elif` statement.\n",
        "4. If the `elif` condition is **true**, the code inside the `elif` block will execute and the rest of the `elif` and `else` blocks will be skipped.\n",
        "5. If all `if` and `elif` conditions are **false**, the code inside the `else` block (if present) will execute.\n",
